# FEND19 - Backend â€“ Project: Content Management System

![preview](readme/cms-preview.jpg)

## Description

The purpose of this project is to develop a simple CMS application that lets you create, read, update and delete blog posts. The system is written in PHP, JavaScript and uses a MySQL database to persist data. The work was performed in a group of two students.

## Implementation

Running SQL queueres on the database is done with the help of DB class that follows the Singleton pattern. A single PDO connection is created and used through the system to avoid opening and closing new connections unnecessarily.

For example, to get the number of blog posts in the database you can simply run:

```php
  return DB::run("SELECT count(*) FROM post")->fetchColumn();
```

A CMS class was created to collect all logical operations on the database such as creating a new blog post, getting the number of blog posts currently in the database and so on.

```html
<section id="main">
  <div class="container">
    <section class="post-list">
      <?php CMS::getPublishedBlogPostsHtml(); ?>
    </section>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Administrator Area

Administrator tool is located in the "admin" subfolder which is protected by a Directory Access lock (grade requirement).

Once correct credetial are entered user gets access to the Administrator panel from which you can see a list of all blog posts stored in the database.

## Creating new posts

```php
  $newBlogPost = [];
  $newBlogPost['date_created'] = date("Y-m-d H:i:s", time());
  // ...
  // build the rest of the blog post
  // ...
  CMS::createBlogPost($newBlogPost);
  header("Location: ../index.php");
  die;
```

## Deleting posts

Each Delete button triggers a javascript functio that sends a asynchronous request to a php routine. This way blog posts can be deleted from the admin page without having to reload it.

```js
deleteBlogPost: function(event) {
  if (confirm("Are you sure?")) {
    const button = event.target.elements.delete;
    const postId = button.dataset.postId;
    const xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
      if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
        // update post counter
        let oldCount = Number(document.querySelector(`span.total-post-count`).textContent);
        document.querySelector(`span.total-post-count`).textContent = oldCount - 1;
        // remove deleted row
        document.querySelector(`tr[data-post-id="${postId}"]`).remove();
      }
    };
    xmlhttp.open("POST", "php-routines/deleteBlogPost.php?postId=" + postId, true);
    xmlhttp.send();
  }
  event.preventDefault();
}
```
