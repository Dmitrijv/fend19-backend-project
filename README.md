![preview](readme/cms-preview.jpg)

## Description

The purpose of this project is to develop a simple CMS application that lets you create, read, update and delete blog posts. The system is written in PHP, JavaScript and uses a MySQL database to persist data. The work was performed in a group of two students.

## Public Area

Blog posts are appended to a section.

```html
<section id="main">
  <div class="container">
    <section class="post-list">
      <?php CMS::getPublishedBlogPosts(); ?>
    </section>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Administrator Area

Administrator tool is located in the "admin" subfolder which is protected by a Directory Access lock (grade requirement).

Once correct credetial are entered user gets access to the Administrator panel from which you can see a list of all blog posts stored in the database.

#### Creating new posts

#### Deleting posts

Each Delete button triggers a javascript functio that sends a asynchronous request to a php routine. This way blog posts can be deleted from the admin page without having to reload it.

```js
deleteBlogPost: function(event) {
  if (confirm("Are you sure?")) {
    const button = event.target.elements.delete;
    const postId = button.dataset.postId;
    const xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
      if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
        // update post counter
        let oldCount = Number(document.querySelector(`span.total-post-count`).textContent);
        document.querySelector(`span.total-post-count`).textContent = oldCount - 1;
        // remove deleted row
        document.querySelector(`tr[data-post-id="${postId}"]`).remove();
      }
    };
    xmlhttp.open("POST", "php-routines/deleteBlogPost.php?postId=" + postId, true);
    xmlhttp.send();
  }
  event.preventDefault();
}
```
